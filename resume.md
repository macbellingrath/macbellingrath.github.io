## About

I love code, and the people who write it.

Programming enables me to translate ideas into products that can be shared with the world. 
I find the constant change and improvement in programming motivating and exciting.

Teams are great, and I enjoy working with others. I am excited for the future of the developer community and for the solutions enabled by programming.

##Writing

**Swift Generics**, [Read](http://macbellingrath.com/blog/2015/08/28/Generic-Types.html)


Generics are self-describing. In Swift, generics allow you to write flexible code that avoids redundancy, but retains clarity. As an example, the swap method in the Swift standard library enables you to swap two instances, as long as they are of the same type. This is achieved through generics.

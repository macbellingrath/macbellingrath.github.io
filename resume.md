## Writing

**Swift Generics**, [Link](http://macbellingrath.com/blog/2015/08/28/Generic-Types.html)


Generics are self-describing. In Swift, generics allow you to write flexible code that avoids redundancy, but retains clarity. As an example, the swap method in the Swift standard library enables you to swap two instances, as long as they are of the same type. This is achieved through generics.

After picking up Wayne Bishop's [*Swift Algorithms and Data Structures*](http://waynewbishop.com/swift/), I became interested in the usage of recursion and other patterns found in functional programming in my own Swift code. Learning more about functional programming in Swift has been a rabbit-hole in the best way. Next came [Functional Programming in Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/). As a multi-paradigm language, writing Swift code in a functional style has been really exciting. A role-model of mine, [NatashaTheRobot](https://www.twitter.com/natashatherobot), has been talking it up for some [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tohEJSq9gds&list=PLZyqQB76XCDkbAR4PwuOJ9IRcmnaxOgxL&index=2).
In Joe Burgess's (of the Flatiron School)  talk during [UIKonf 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46nJlZ3RT_I), he explains how Haskell can direct the way that we learn Swift. Per Natasha's recommendation, I just began the [Introduction to Functional Programming](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0) on edx.org. I cannot wait to see how many lessons I learn about Swift through learning Haskell. Check out the lesson and a repo I setup for the course [here](https://github.com/macbellingrath/DelftX---FP101x).

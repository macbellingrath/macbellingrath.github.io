# Worms

Let's pretend that with an empty bottle, we place one worm inside that multiplies at a rate of 2x / second . At 30 seconds, the bottle is full. With the same empty bottle, placing two worms inside at the same growth rate, how many seconds will it take to fill the bottle?

To find the number of worms at the point that it is full, we model by  __f(t) = 2^t__ _where t is the number of seconds_ getting something like p(30) = 2^30

```swift
func calculateNumberOfWorms(initial: Int = 1, growthRatePerSecond rate: UInt = 2, seconds: UInt) -> Int {
    
    return initial * Int(pow(Double(rate), Double(seconds)))
}

calculateNumberOfWorms(seconds: 30)

//: Prints 1,073,741,824
```

With 2 worms at t = 0, we'd have _instead_ __f(t) = 2(2^t)__. The bottle will still be full with 2^30 worms. To solve for t, we can set the two equations equal 2(2^t) = 2^30.

We'll divide both sides by 2, to get __2^t = 2^30 / 2__ then, we'll simplify -> 2^30 / 2^1 =  2^30 - 1 or 2^t = 2^29. We can divide both sides by 2 to get rid of the coefficient giving us t = 29 (29 seconds).

```swift
func calculateSecondsToFillBottle(initial: Int = 2, timeToFill t: Double) -> Double {

    
    // 2(2^t) = 2^30
    let lhs = 2.0 * pow(2, t)
    let rhs: Double = pow(2, t)
    
    // 2^t = (2^30 / 2)
    let a = lhs / 2
    let b = rhs / 2
    
    return log2(b)
    
}

calculateSecondsToFillBottle(2, timeToFill: 30)
```

Let me check my math.

```swift
let check = log2(pow(2.0, 29.0)) == calculateSecondsToFillBottle(2, timeToFill: 30)

//: Returns 'true'
```

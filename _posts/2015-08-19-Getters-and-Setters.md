title: Getters and Setters
---

Properties can have getters and setters that offer a lot of convenience, especially in cases where you are doing a lot of calculation. After the declaration, all you have to do is write get and set, each followed by a set of curly braces. With these types of computed properties, we can determine the value of a variable by calculation. The setter allows us to set the values of other related variables when a new value is assigned to the computed property.
